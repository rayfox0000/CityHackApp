# CityHackApp

How often do you lose your parking ticket? Smartphones have become inevitable in our daily lives. Therefore, we have came 
up with an idea to develop this Android application to solve the common problem in an urban city. Imagine that entering a parking lot, you just need to scan your fingerprint to unlock your phone, activate SmartParking app, 
and let the machine to scan through the uniquely generate qr code. There will be less hassle comparing to wiping down the car 
window to wait for the printing of parking tickets or tapping your touch â€˜n go card. As qr code can be detected from distance, 
it indirectly resolve a popular issue especially for women such as drivers that have difficulties to reach out the ticket machine.
We can go cashless and paperless in order to stay sustainable with SmartParking.
